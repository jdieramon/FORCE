## Summary

Flowering time involves the transition from vegetative growth to the flowering state and it
refers to the number of days from sowing to the appearance of the first fully opened flower.
Flowering time is the major domestication trait defining the adaptation of chickpea to
different agro-climatic conditions, and therefore is a major determinant of its productivity.
Despite early flowering time being suggested as a means to increase chickpea adaptability
roughly 45 years ago , studies on the genetic control of flowering time have appeared only
within the 21st century. Although classical genetic analyses have provided a wealth of
valuable information, the molecular identities of genes underlying the major flowering time
locus remains mostly elusive.
